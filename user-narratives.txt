Hi, I am looking for a place to live on craigslist and I want to check how good the landlord is. I go to Yelp for Landlords and I put in the address. This let's me see reviews of the unit and the landlord. I can see how rapidly the the landlord gets things done. How friendly they are. And if there are any complaints from previous tenants. 

Hi, I'm a renter and just had a bad experience not getting my security deposit back from my landlord. I go and leave a review. I put in the exact address of the unit and explain what happened. 

Hi, I'm a landlord and want to see my reviews. I look up different units and follow them to get updates when reviews are posted. I add some of my other units and I send out requests to the tenants to rate me favorably.
